# ⚔️ Problem Solving / DSA Archive

This repository is dedicated to my training in **Problem Solving** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

My focus here is not just on *solving* the problem, but solving it with **optimal time complexity** and **clean, maintainable C++ code** while explaining the thought process behind the solutions.

I will be following the **NeetCode roadmap**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

* **Current Focus:** NeetCode ALL & Codeforces
* **Primary Language:** C++
* **Daily Goal:** 2 Problems per Day

## ✅ Coding Standards
# 1.0 The Solution File
Every solution in this repository adheres to the following format.

Every .cpp file must include a header comment block detailing the complexity.

/**
 * Problem:  [Problem Name]
 * Link:     [Url to problem]
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Time Complexity:  O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Approach: Two Pointers
 */

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    // Optimized solution
}
# 2.0 The Documentation (NOTES.md)

For harder problems, a NOTES.md file is included in the problem folder containing:
The Intuition: Why did I choose this approach?
Visuals: Graphs or ASCII art if needed.Edge 
Cases: What if $N=0$? What if logic overflows?

## 📂 Repository Structure

Solutions are separated by **Platform** first, then by **Category/Rating**. I will also try to make and share my own notes on challenging topics.
